I've completed the basics and am now focusing on **intermediate concepts**, diving deeper into more advanced JavaScript topics. Stay tuned for mini-projects and hands-on exercises as I apply these new skills.

## ðŸŒŸCurrent Focus   
I'm currently learning:  
- **Classes**: Object-oriented programming concepts for better structure and reusability.  
- **Modules**: Organizing code into reusable pieces.  
- **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations with cleaner, more readable syntax.  
- **Async-Await**: Writing asynchronous code that feels synchronous.  
- **Requests**: Interacting with APIs and managing HTTP requests.  
- **Error Handling**: Building robust applications by managing and recovering from errors.
