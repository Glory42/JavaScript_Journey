# JavaScript Learning Journey ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

This repository is created to document my progress and practice code as I learn JavaScript through Codecademy. It contains code snippets and exercises that demonstrate the concepts Iâ€™ve learned.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a log of my JavaScript learning journey. It showcases the topics I've covered, with examples and simple implementations of the concepts. Iâ€™ve organized my work here as I continue to grow my JavaScript skills.

## My Progress

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key topics Iâ€™ve covered so far:

- **Variables and Data Types**  
  Understanding how to declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`, and exploring primitive data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.

- **Conditionals**  
  Learning how to use `if`, `else if`, `else`, and the ternary operator to control program flow.

- **Functions**  
  Creating reusable blocks of code with function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.

- **Scope**  
  Understanding variable accessibility in global, function, and block scopes.

- **Arrays**  
  Working with ordered lists of elements, accessing and modifying them with methods like `push`, `pop`, and `splice`.

- **Loops**  
  Repeating actions with `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops.

- **Iterators**  
  Using higher-order functions like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to work with arrays.

- **Objects**  
  Representing real-world entities with key-value pairs, and working with object properties and methods.

## Projects and Exercises

- **Topic-Based Exercises**: Each folder contains code snippets and challenges to reinforce specific concepts.  
- **Mini-Projects**: Simple projects like calculators, basic games, or form validations to put theory into practice.
