## 🚀 Mission Control: Topics Explored  

I’ve ventured into the following JavaScript dimensions:  

### 🧩 The Basics  
- **Variables & Data Types**: Declaring variables (`let`, `const`, `var`) and understanding the building blocks of data.  
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions with `if-else` and `switch`.  

### 🛠️ Core Skills  
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code with function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.  
- **Loops**: Repeating actions with `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.  
- **Arrays & Objects**: Manipulating and organizing data like a pro.  

### 🌟 Advanced Explorations  
- **Iterators**: Using powerful methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for cleaner, functional code.  
- **Scope**: Understanding the where, how, and why of variables.
