## 🚀 **Progress Overview**

Here’s a glimpse of the topics I’ve covered so far:

- **✨ Variables and Data Types**  
  Mastering the use of `let`, `const`, and `var`, and working with numbers, strings, booleans, and more.  

- **⚖️ Conditionals**  
  Writing decision-making structures using `if`, `else if`, `else`, and the ternary operator.

- **🔄 Functions**  
  Understanding reusable blocks of code, including function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.

- **🔍 Scope**  
  Exploring variable accessibility across global, function, and block scopes.

- **📋 Arrays**  
  Learning to manipulate arrays with methods like `push`, `pop`, `splice`, and `slice`.

- **🔁 Loops**  
  Automating repetitive tasks using `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops.

- **🔧 Iterators**  
  Using higher-order methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for functional programming.

- **🗂️ Objects**  
  Structuring data with key-value pairs, and working with object properties and methods.
